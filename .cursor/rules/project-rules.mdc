## Code Quality Standards

### Clean Code Principles
- **SOLID**: Apply Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and other SOLID principles
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - eliminate code duplication
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - avoid over-engineering
- **Readability**: Code should be easy to read and understand

### Testing Standards
- **TDD Approach**: Write ONE failing test → implement minimal code to pass → refactor → repeat
- **Theory Tests Priority**: Theory tests (`[Theory]` with `[InlineData]`) are PRIORITY for parameterized testing scenarios
- **Regular Analysis**: Analyze test classes regularly to ensure optimal organization using xUnit features
- **Consolidation**: Consolidate similar test scenarios using `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]`, `[MemberData]`, or `[ClassData]`
- **Helper Methods**: Create helper methods to eliminate repetitive arrange sections
- **Short Tests**: Keep test methods short and focused (ideally under 15 lines)
- **Clean Tests**: Apply the same clean code principles to test code
- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive test method names following `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern
- **Functional Organization**: Organize tests by functionality, not by implementation details
